Maxwells fish-eye lens and the mirage of perfect imaging	Recent claims that Maxwells fish-eye is a perfect lens, capable of providing images withdeep subwavelength resolution, are examined. We show that the imaging properties of adispersionless fish-eye are very similar to those of an ideal spherical cavity. Using thiscorrespondence, we prove that the correct solution to Maxwell equations in the fish-eyegives image sizes that are consistent with the standard diffraction limit. Perfect focusing isan optical illusion that results from placing a time-reversed source at the position of thegeometrical image which, when combined with the field due to the primary (object) source,mimics the behavior of a perfect drain. Issues of causality are briefly discussed. We alsodemonstrate that passive outlets are not a good alternative to time-reversed sourcesfor broadband drain-like behavior and that, even if they were, they could notdo a better job than conventional optical systems at providing high resolution.

Underwater thrust and power generation using flexible piezoelectric composites: anexperimental investigation toward self-powered swimmer-sensor platforms	Fiber-based flexible piezoelectric composites offer several advantages to use in energyharvesting and biomimetic locomotion. These advantages include ease of application,high power density, effective bending actuation, silent operation over a rangeof frequencies, and light weight. Piezoelectric materials exhibit the well-knowndirect and converse piezoelectric effects. The direct piezoelectric effect has receivedgrowing attention for low-power generation to use in wireless electronic applicationswhile the converse piezoelectric effect constitutes an alternative to replace theconventional actuators used in biomimetic locomotion. In this paper, underwaterthrust and electricity generation are investigated experimentally by focusing onbiomimetic structures with macro-fiber composite piezoelectrics. Fish-like bimorphconfigurations with and without a passive caudal fin (tail) are fabricated andcompared. The favorable effect of having a passive caudal fin on the frequencybandwidth is reported. The presence of a passive caudal fin is observed to bringthe second bending mode close to the first one, yielding a wideband behavior inthrust generation. The same smart fish configuration is tested for underwaterpiezoelectric power generation in response to harmonic excitation from its head.Resonant piezohydroelastic actuation is reported to generate milli-newton levelhydrodynamic thrust using milli-watt level actuation power input. The average actuationpower requirement for generating a mean thrust of 19mN at 6Hz using a 10gpiezoelastic fish with a caudal fin is measured as 120mW. This work also discussesthe feasibility of thrust generation using the harvested energy toward enablingself-powered swimmer-sensor platforms with comparisons based on the capacity levels ofstructural thin-film battery layers as well as harvested solar and vibrational energy.

Salmon jumping: behavior, kinematics and optimal conditions, with possible implications for fish passageway design	Behavioral and kinematic properties and capacities of wild migratory salmonid fishes swimming upstream and jumping up waterfalls generally have played only minor roles in the design and construction of passageways intended to help these fishes get past dams and other human-made obstacles blocking their movements. This paper reports the results of an experimental study of relevant behavioral and kinematic properties of adult kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) jumping up waterfalls as they migrate upstream. We used a portable, adjustable apparatus to study in the field fish responding to artificial waterfalls under a range of flow conditions. We observed fish under conditions of varying water flow rates, pool depths, fall heights and fall angles. We analyzed digital video recordings of their behaviors. Kokanee salmon spontaneously jump up waterfalls within a relatively narrow range of conditions, including low flow speeds, near vertical angles and pool depth to fall height ratios near 1.0. Preferred values for each parameter are, to some extent, dependent on other parameters. In contrast to previous misconceptions, jumping behavior is initiated by running S-start accelerations from beneath the boils formed in the plunge pools below waterfalls, as opposed to C-start standing jumps from the surface. S-starts are immediately followed by burst swimming to the point of takeoff at the surface. These results can contribute to an improved basis for developing designs of fish passageways that may ultimately make them more effective and efficient.

Physics in contexta means to encourage student interest in physics	Physics instruction that is student oriented will generate a long-term individual interestand therefore a lifelong openness to science. Phenomena of nature are part ofthe fields of interest which provide context leading to greater student interest.In this paper we present the locomotion of fish and sperm in a way which can be used toteach in physics classes. For the development of the topic, a free computer simulation canbe downloaded, which illustrates the different kinds of movement pertaining to fish:paddling, oscillation and undulation. The physics of the three different kinds of movementis explained in the simulation by demonstrating the force vectors that are relevant.

Locomotion with flexible propulsors: II. Computational modeling of pectoral fin swimming in sunfish	This paper describes a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based investigation of the pectoral fin hydrodynamics of a bluegill sunfish. The pectoral fin of this fish undergoes significant shape-change during its abductionadduction cycle and the effect of this deformation on the thrust performance remains far from understood. The current study is part of a combined experimentalnumerical approach wherein the numerical simulations are being used to examine features and issues that are not easily amenable to the experiments. These numerical simulations are highly challenging and we briefly describe the computational methodology that has been developed to handle such flows. Finally, we describe some of the key computational results including wake vortex topologies and hydrodynamics forces.

Comment on Perfect imaging without negative refraction	The prediction of perfect imaging without negative refraction for Maxwell's fish-eye lens (Leonhardt U 2009 New J. Phys.11 093040) is a consequence of imposing an active localized drain at the image point rather than being a general property of the lens. This work then becomes analogous to other work using time-reversal symmetry and/or structured antennae to achieve super-resolution, which can be applied to many types of imaging system beyond the fish-eye lens.

Frequency spectra of absolute optical instruments	We analyse frequency spectra of absolute optical instruments and show that they have very specific properties: the eigenfrequencies form tight groups that are almost equidistantly spaced. We prove this by theoretical analysis and demonstrate by numerically calculated spectra of various examples of absolute instruments. We also show that in rotationally and spherically symmetric absolute instruments a source, its image and the centre of the device must lie on a straight line.

Synergistic effects of micropatterned biodegradable conduits and Schwann cells on sciatic nerve regeneration	This paper describes a novel biodegradable conduit that provides a combination of physical, chemical and biological cues at the cellular level to facilitate peripheral nerve regeneration. The conduit consists of a porous poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) tubular support structure with a micropatterned inner lumen. Schwann cells were pre-seeded into the lumen to provide additional trophic support. Conduits with micropatterned inner lumens pre-seeded with Schwann cells (MS) were fabricated and compared with three types of conduits used as controls: M (conduits with micropatterned inner lumens without pre-seeded Schwann cells), NS (conduits without micropatterned inner lumens pre-seeded with Schwann cells) and N (conduits without micropatterned inner lumens, without pre-seeded Schwann cells). The conduits were implanted in rats with 1 cm sciatic nerve transections and the regeneration and functional recovery were compared in the four different cases. The number or size of regenerated axons did not vary significantly among the different conduits. The time of recovery, and the sciatic function index, however, were significantly enhanced using the MS conduits, based on qualitative observations as well as quantitative measurements using walking track analysis. This demonstrates that biodegradable micropatterned conduits pre-seeded with Schwann cells that provide a combination of physical, chemical and biological guidance cues for regenerating axons at the cellular level offer a better alternative for repairing sciatic nerve transactions than conventional biodegradable conduits.

Perfect imaging without negative refraction	Perfect imaging has been believed to rely on negative refraction, but here we show that an ordinary positively refracting optical medium may form perfect images as well. In particular, we establish a mathematical proof that Maxwell's fish eye in two-dimensional (2D) integrated optics makes a perfect instrument with a resolution not limited by the wavelength of light. We also show how to modify the fish eye such that perfect imaging devices can be made in practice. Our method of perfect focusing may also find applications outside of optics, in acoustics, fluid mechanics or quantum physics, wherever waves obey the 2D Helmholtz equation.

Food and water security in a changing arctic climate	In the Arctic, permafrost extends up to 500m below the ground surface, and it is generallyjust the top metre that thaws in summer. Lakes, rivers, and wetlands on the arcticlandscape are normally not connected with groundwater in the same way that they are intemperate regions. When the surface is frozen in winter, only lakes deeper than 2m andrivers with significant flow retain liquid water. Surface water is largely abundant insummer, when it serves as a breeding ground for fish, birds, and mammals. Inwinter, many mammals and birds are forced to migrate out of the Arctic. Fishmust seek out lakes or rivers deep enough to provide good overwintering habitat.Humans in the Arctic rely on surface water in many ways. Surface water meets domesticneeds such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning as well as subsistence and industrialdemands. Indigenous communities depend on sea ice and waterways for transportationacross the landscape and access to traditional country foods. The minerals, mining, andoil and gas industries also use large quantities of surface water during winterto build ice roads and maintain infrastructure. As demand for this limited, butheavily-relied-upon resource continues to increase, it is now more critical than ever tounderstand the impacts of climate change on food and water security in the Arctic.

Bio-inspired particle separator design based on the food retention mechanism by suspension-feeding fish	A new particle separator is designed using a crossflow filtration mechanism inspired by suspension-feeding fish in this study. To construct the model of the bio-inspired particle separator, computational fluid dynamics techniques are used, and parameters related toseparator shape, fluid flow and particle properties that might affect the performance in removing particles from the flow, are varied and tested. The goal is to induce a flow rotation which enhances the separation of particles from the flow, reduce the particle-laden flow that exits via a collection zone at the lower/posterior end of the separator, while at the same time increase the concentration of particles in that flow. Based on preliminary particle removal efficiency tests, an exiting flow through the collection zone of about 8 of the influent flow rate is selected for all the performance tests of the separator including trials with particles carried by air flow instead of water. Under this condition, the simulation results yield similar particle removal efficiencies in water and air but with different particle properties. Particle removal efficiencies (percentage of influent particles that exit through the collection zone) were determined for particles ranging in size from 1 to 1500m with a density between 1000 and 1150kg m3in water and 2 and 19mm and 68 and 2150kg m3in air. As an example, removal efficiencies are 66 and 64 for 707m diameter particles with a density of 1040kgm3in water and for 2mm particles with a density of 68kg m3in air, respectively. No significant performance difference is found by geometrically scaling the inlet diameter of the separator up or down in the range from 2.5 to 10cm.

Perfect imaging without refraction	Recent work suggesting that perfect far-field imaging is possible using Maxwell's fish-eye lens (Leonhardt 2009 New J. Phys. 11 093040) has raised a number of questions and controversies about the nature of imaging and field localization in inhomogeneous media. In this brief paper we present analogous results for a purely reflector-based imaging systeman elliptical cavity. With a source at one focus of the ellipse we show that sub-wavelength field localization can be achieved at the other focus when an active drain is present there, but not without it. Does this show that far-field perfect imaging is possible even without refraction (negative or positive) Unfortunately not, giving further evidence that these are solely drain-induced effects.

An exactly solvable coarse-grained model for species diversity	We present novel analytical results concerning ecosystem species diversity that stem from a proposed coarse-grained neutral model based on birthdeath processes. The relevance of the problem lies in the urgency for understanding and synthesizing both theoretical results from ecological neutral theory and empirical evidence on species diversity preservation. The neutral model of biodiversity deals with ecosystems at the same trophic level, where per capita vital rates are assumed to be species independent. Closed-form analytical solutions for the neutral theory are obtained within a coarse-grained model, where the only input is the species persistence time distribution. Our results pertain to: the probability distribution function of the number of species in the ecosystem, both in transient and in stationary states; the n-point connected time correlation function; and the survival probability, defined as the distribution of time spans to local extinction for a species randomly sampled from the community. Analytical predictions are also tested on empirical data from an estuarine fish ecosystem. We find that emerging properties of the ecosystem are very robust and do not depend on specific details of the model, with implications for biodiversity and conservation biology.

Miniaturized multi-sensor for aquatic studies	We have developed and fabricated a multi-sensor chip for fisheries research and demonstrated the functionality under controlled conditions. The outer dimensions of the sensor chip are 3.0 7.4 0.8 mm3 and both sides of the chip are utilized for sensors. Hereby a more compact chip is achieved that allows for direct exposure to the seawater and thereby more accurate measurements. The chip contains a piezo-resistive pressure sensor, a pn-junction photodiode sensitive to visible light, a four-terminal platinum resistor for temperature measurement and four conductivity electrodes for the determination of the salinity of saltwater. Pressure, light intensity, temperature and salinity are all essential parameters when mapping the migration route of fish. The pressure sensor has a sensitivity of S 1.44 107 Pa1 and is optimized to 20 bar pressure; the light sensor has a quantum efficiency between 52 and 74 in the range of visible light. The temperature sensor responds linearly with temperature and has a temperature coefficient of resistance of 2.9 103 K1. The conductivity sensor can measure the salinity with an accuracy of 0.1 psu. This is all together the smallest and best functioning fully integrated MEMS-based multi-sensor made to date for this specific application. However, each single-sensor performance can be optimized by introducing a considerably more complicated process sequence. In this paper, a new simpler process for integrating the four sensors on one single chip is presented in details for the first time. Further, an optimized performance of the individual sensors is presented.	Karen Birkelund, Anders Hyldgrd, Dennis Mortensen, Erik V Thomsen	Measurement Science and Technology	2011	1	1

Visualization of chromatic correction of fish lenses by multiple focal lengths	Many fish and some terrestrial animals have multifocal lenses that compensate forchromatic aberration by a mechanism unique to biological optical systems. We describefour optical methods for the study of such lenses. Significantly improved methods(focal-area imaging, schlieren photography, and laser scanning) are explained infull detail. One method (photorefractometry) was only slightly modified overearlier versions and is illustrated in brief. Portable equipment is available forphotorefractometry, schlieren photography, and laser scanning. With our methodswe could for the first time directly illustrate chromatic correction by multifocallenses and detect a number of previously unknown optical features of fish lenses.

Short-term ecological effects of an offshore wind farm in the Dutch coastal zone;acompilation	The number of offshore wind farms is increasing rapidly, leading to questions about theenvironmental impact of such farms. In the Netherlands, an extensive monitoringprogramme is being executed at the first offshore wind farm (Offshore Windfarm Egmondaan Zee, OWEZ). This letter compiles the short-term (twoyears) results on a large numberof faunal groups obtained so far. Impacts were expected from the new hard substratum, themoving rotor blades, possible underwater noise and the exclusion of fisheries. The resultsindicate no short-term effects on the benthos in the sandy area between the generators,while the new hard substratum of the monopiles and the scouring protection led to theestablishment of new species and new fauna communities. Bivalve recruitmentwas not impacted by the OWEZ wind farm. Species composition of recruits inOWEZ and the surrounding reference areas is correlated with mud content of thesediment and water depth irrespective the presence of OWEZ. Recruit abundances inOWEZ were correlated with mud content, most likely to be attributed not to thepresence of the farm but to the absence of fisheries. The fish community was highlydynamic both in time and space. So far, only minor effects upon fish assemblagesespecially near the monopiles have been observed. Some fish species, such ascod, seem to find shelter inside the farm. More porpoise clicks were recordedinside the farm than in the reference areas outside the farm. Several bird speciesseem to avoid the park while others are indifferent or are even attracted. Theeffects of the wind farm on a highly variable ecosystem are described. Overall, theOWEZ wind farm acts as a new type of habitat with a higher biodiversity ofbenthic organisms, a possibly increased use of the area by the benthos, fish, marinemammals and some bird species and a decreased use by several other bird species.

Locomotion with flexible propulsors: I. Experimental analysis of pectoral fin swimming in sunfish	A full understanding of the mechanics of locomotion can be achieved by incorporating descriptions of (1) three-dimensional kinematics of propulsor movement, (2) material properties of the propulsor, (3) power input and control and (4) the fluid dynamics effects of propulsor motion into (5) a three-dimensional computational framework that models the complexity of propulsors that deform and change area. In addition, robotic models would allow for further experimental investigation of changes to propulsor design and for testing of hypothesized relationships between movement and force production. Such a comprehensive suite of data is not yet available for any flexible propulsor. In this paper, we summarize our research program with the goal of producing a comprehensive data set for each of the five components noted above through a study of pectoral fin locomotion in one species of fish: the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus. Many fish use pectoral fins exclusively for locomotion, and pectoral fins in most fish are integral to generating force during maneuvering. Pectoral fins are complex structures composed of jointed bony supports that are under active control via pectoral fin musculature. During propulsion in sunfish, the fin deforms considerably, has two leading edges, and sunfish can rotate the whole fin or just control individual sections to vector thrust. Fin material properties vary along the length of fin rays and among rays. Experimental fluid dynamic analysis of sunfish pectoral fin locomotion reveals that the fin generates thrust throughout the fin beat cycle, and that the upper and lower edges each produce distinct simultaneous leading edge vortices. The following companion paper provides data on the computational approach taken to understand locomotion using flexible pectoral fins.

Atmospheric pressure plasma produced inside a closed package by a dielectric barrier discharge in Ar/CO2 for bacterial inactivation of biological samples	The generation and evaluation of a dielectric barrier discharge produced inside a closed package made of a commercially available packaging film and filled with gas mixtures of Ar/CO2 at atmospheric pressure is reported. The discharge parameters were analysed by electrical measurements and optical emission spectroscopy in two modes of operation: trapped gas atmosphere and flowing gas atmosphere. Gas temperature was estimated using the OH(AX) emission spectrum and the rotational temperature reached a saturation level after a few minutes of plasma running. The rotational temperature was almost three times higher in the Ar/CO2 plasma compared with an Ar plasma. The efficiency of the produced plasma for the inactivation of bacteria on food inside the closed package was investigated.

Parametric study of the swimming performance of a fish robot propelled by a flexible caudal fin	In this paper, we aim to study the swimming performance of fish robots by using a statistical approach. A fish robot employing a carangiform swimming mode had been used as an experimental platform for the performance study. The experiments conducted aim to investigate the effect of various design parameters on the thrust capability of the fish robot with a flexible caudal fin. The controllable parameters associated with the fin include frequency, amplitude of oscillation, aspect ratio and the rigidity of the caudal fin. The significance of these parameters was determined in the first set of experiments by using a statistical approach. A more detailed parametric experimental study was then conducted with only those significant parameters. As a result, the parametric study could be completed with a reduced number of experiments and time spent. With the obtained experimental result, we were able to understand the relationship between various parameters and a possible adjustment of parameters to obtain a higher thrust. The proposed statistical method for experimentation provides an objective and thorough analysis of the effects of individual or combinations of parameters on the swimming performance. Such an efficient experimental design helps to optimize the process and determine factors that influence variability.	K H Low, C W Chong	Bioinspiration & Biomimetics	2010	1	1
A model of the lateral line of fish for vortex sensing	In this paper, the lateral line trunk canal (LLTC) of a fish is modeled to investigate how it is affected by an external flow field. Potential flow theory is adopted to model the flow field around a fish's body in the presence of a Karman vortex street. Karman and reverse Karman streets represent the flow patterns behind a bluff body and a traveling fish, respectively. An analytical solution is obtained for a flat body, while a fish-like body is modeled using a Joukowski transformation and the corresponding equations are solved numerically. The pressure distribution on the body surface is then computed employing Bernoulli's equation. For a known external flow, the flow inside the LLTC is driven by the pressure gradient between a pair of consecutive pores, which can be solved analytically. Governing dimensionless parameters are obtained from this analytical solution, and the effects of these numbers on the amplitude or features of the velocity distribution inside the canal are studied. The results show that the main characteristics of a vortex street including the magnitude of vortices, their translational speed, their spacing, their distance from the fish's body and the angle of the vortex street axis can all be recovered by measuring the velocity distribution along the canal and its changes with time. To this end, the proposed LLTC model could explain how a fish identifies the characteristics of a Karman vortex street shed by a nearby object or a traveling fish. It is also demonstrated that while this model captures the ac (alternating current) component of the external velocity signal, the dc (direct current) component of the signal is filtered out. Based on the results of our model, the role of the LLTC in a fish's schooling and its evolutionary impact on fish sensing are discussed.

An experimental study on the excitation of large volume airguns in a small volume body of water	A large volume airgun array is effective in generating seismic waves, which is extensively used in large volume bodies of water such as oceans, lakes and reservoirs. So far, the application of large volume airguns is subject to the distribution of large volume bodies of water. This paper reports an attempt to utilize large volume airguns in a small body of water as a seismic source for seismotectonic studies. We carried out a field experiment in Mapaoquan pond, Fangshan district, Beijing, during the period 2530 May 2009. Bolt LL1500 airguns, each with volumes of 2000 in3, the largest commercial airguns available today, were used in this experiment. We tested the excitation of the airgun array with one or two guns. The airgun array was placed 711 m below the water's surface. The near- and far-field seismic motions induced by the airgun source were recorded by a 100 km long seismic profile composed of 16 portable seismometers and a 100 m long strong motion seismograph profile, respectively. The following conclusions can be drawn from this experiment. First, it is feasible to excite large volume airguns in a small volume body of water. Second, seismic signals from a single shot of one airgun can be recognized at the offset up to 15 km. Taking advantage of high source repeatability, we stacked records from 128 shots to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and direct P-waves can be easily identified at the offset 50 km in stacked records. Third, no detectable damage to fish or near-field constructions was caused by the airgun shots. Those results suggest that large volume airguns excited in small bodies of water can be used as a routinely operated seismic source for mid-scale (tens of kilometres) subsurface explorations and monitoring under various running conditions.

Automatic Segmentation of Overlapping Fish Using Shape Priors	Abstract: We present results from a study where we segment fish in images captured within fish cages. The ultimate goal is to use this information to extract the weight distribution of the fish within the cages. Statistical shape knowledge is added to a Mumford-Shah functional defining the image energy. The fish shape is represented explicitly by a polygonal curve, and the energy minimization is done by gradient descent. The images represent many challenges with a highly cluttered background, inhomogeneous lighting and several overlapping objects. We obtain good segmentation results for silhouette-like images containing relatively few fish. In this case, the fish appear dark on a light background and the image energy is well behaved. In cases with more difficult lighting conditions the contours evolve slowly and often get trapped in local minima	Sigmund Clausen, Katharina Greiner, Odd Andersen, Knut-Andreas Lie, Helene Schulerud, Tom Kavli	Image Analysis	2007	1	1
Changes in proteins and nonprotein Nitrogen Compounds in Cured, Fermented, and Dried Seafoods	Abstract: The objective of salting, fermenting, marinating, drying, and smoking of fish and marine invertebrates is to increase the shelf life and to develop in the products the desirable sensory properties. The storage life extension in various products is achieved mainly due to the different combined effects of low water activity, reduction in the number of vegetative forms of the microflora by heat, the preservative action of acetic acid and added chemical preservatives, and the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of various smoke components. The sensory properties of the products, typical for the different commodities, develop as a result of changes in lipids and nitrogenous compounds in the tissues caused by chemical and enzymatic processes controlled by the parameters of processing, principally the temperature, pH, and the presence of salts and other reactive components (Doe and O11ey, 1990; Shenderyuk and Bykowski, 1990; Miler and Sikorski, 1990).

Test of a Model of Regulation of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish by Fish Predators	Abstract: Both a population dynamic model and simplified calculations of the numbers of fish predators that would be required to control heavy recruitment of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci L.) predict threshold densities of fish predators below which starfish population outbreaks may occur. This prediction has been tested through comparable surveys of putative fish predators in the Red Sea, where no major outbreaks of A. planci were found or are known to have occurred, and on the Great Barrier Reef, where two major series of outbreaks have occurred during the last 25 years. In the Red Sea densities of presumed fish predators were found to be well above the predicted threshold. By contrast on the Great Barrier Reef mean densities both of proposed fish predators of juvenile and subadult A. planci, and of know fish predators of adult A. planci, were below the predicted threshold. Moreover the densities of fish predators on four mid-shelf reefs that are believed to have escaped major outbreaks of A. planci were found to be significantly higher than those on otherwise similar but impacted reefs. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that current and recent outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef have been facilitated by the presence of only relatively low numbers of fish predators, the numbers of which may have been decreased as a result of the intensification of fishing pressure that has occurred from the 1960s onwards.

Self-organized critical branching in systems that violate conservation laws	A non-conservative critical branching model is proposed to demonstrate that self-organized criticality (SOC) can occur in mean-field sandpiles that violate a conservation law. The critical state is characterized by avalanche sizes and lifetimes that obey an inverse power-law distribution with exponents S 3/2 and T 2, respectively. Criticality is achieved when the branching process is coupled to a background activity characterized by the spontaneous switching between refractoriness and quiescence among system components. The stationary state of the system is analysed mathematically and numerically, and is shown to exhibit a transition from a subcritical phase to a critical phase. SOC in sandpile models has been widely believed to occur only when grains are conserved during avalanches. However, such a conservation law is likely to be violated by open, non-equilibrium systems such as biological networks and socially interacting systems like animal groups. The model explores the role of dynamic synapses and synaptic plasticity in maintaining criticality of cortical networks. These brain networks have been found to display neuronal avalanches that obey a power-law distribution. The non-conservative model also emulates the main features of the size distributions of free-swimming tuna schools and red deer herds. Demonstrating criticality in self-organizing systems that violate conservation laws enhances the predictive ability of the theory of SOC in the arena of biocomplexity.

Modeling, Simulation and Control of Fish-Like Swimming	Abstract: We consider modeling and simulation of two-dimensional flows past deformable bodies. The incompressible Navier – Stokes equations are discretized in space on a fixed Cartesian mesh and the bodies are taken into account using a penalization method. The interfaces between the bodies and the fluid are tracked using a level-set description. It is thus possible to simulate several bodies freely evolving in the fluid. The application considered is fish-like swimming and the propulsion efficiency for different swimming modes is investigated.	Michel Bergmann, Angelo Iollo	Computational Fluid Dynamics 2010	2011	1	1
Development of a 3-DOF Fish Robot ‘ICHTHUS V5’	Abstract: In recent, there is a rising interest on studying fish-like underwater robots because of real fish’s great maneuverability and high energy efficiency. However, researches about the fish-like underwater robots have not been investigated so much and there are still diverse problems in respect of using of the fish robot in the real environment such as in the river for detecting water pollution. For example, the fish robot has a short operating time and cannot move narrow passage such as swimming between aquatic plants. Therefore, this paper mainly describes a development of robotic fish which can be used for water quality monitoring system. The fish robot ‘Ichthus V5’ has a 3-DOF serial link-mechanism and is developed in KITECH. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic equation of the fish robot to use the underwater environment. We added several sensors to navigate autonomously in the real environment like river. Also, we added two kinds of sensor to detect temperature, electric conductivity, pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of water. Therefore, the developed system can be applied to environmental monitoring system for detect pollution or quality of river.

Catastrophe-Type Regulation of Pelagic Fish Stocks: Adaptive Management for Evolving Resources	Abstract: The temporary extinction of coastal pelagic marine fish populations during unpredictable time periods appears to be a natural phenomenon. For these short life cycle species (life span of 4 to 8 years) the appearance of quick and sustained recoveries after extinction that lasts decades to centuries is common. Considering previous results in terrestrial evolutionary ecology, we hypothesize that the duration of low biomass levels are the result of strong interspecific selective pressures and poor population fitness, with only minor impacts of climatic fluctuations. The recovery of depleted populations could be the result of an adaptive process. A model using catastrophe theory illustrates long term regulations of these ecological systems. Temporary extinctions could appear as a regulatory process of the population adaptability to the environment. Some improvement should be expected in the management of these evolving resources by using a ‘groping strategy’.	Philippe Cury	The Exploitation of Evolving Resources	1993	1	1

Image Segmentation with Improved Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm	Abstract: Some improved adaptive methods about step length are proposed in the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), which is a new heuristic intelligent optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that proposed methods have better performances such as good and fast global convergence, strong robustness, insensitivity to initial values, and simplicity of implementation. We apply the method in the image processing for the multi-threshold image segmentation compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The properties are discussed and analysed at the end.	Mingyan Jiang, Nikos E. Mastorakis, Dongfeng Yuan, Miguel Angel Lagunas	Proceedings of the European Computing Conference	2009	1	1
Highly sensitive and selective trimethylamine sensor using one-dimensional ZnOCr2O3 hetero-nanostructures	Highly selective and sensitive detection of trimethylamine (TMA) was achieved by the decoration of discrete p-type Cr2O3 nanoparticles on n-type ZnO nanowire (NW) networks. Semielliptical Cr2O3 nanoparticles with lateral widths of 38nm were deposited on ZnO NWs by the thermal evaporation of CrCl2 at 630C, while a continuous Cr2O3 shell layer with a thickness of 3040nm was uniformly coated on ZnO NWs at 670C. The response (RaRg: Ra, resistance in air; Rg, resistance in gas) to 5ppm TMA of Cr2O3-decorated ZnO NWs was 17.8 at 400C, which was 2.4 times higher than that to 5ppm C2H5OH and 4.38.4 times higher than those to 5ppm p-xylene, NH3, benzene, C3H8, toluene, CO, and H2. In contrast, both pristine ZnO and ZnO (core)Cr2O3 (shell) nanocables (NCs) showed comparable responses to the different gases. The highly selective and sensitive detection of TMA that was achieved by the deposition of semielliptical Cr2O3 nanoparticles on ZnO NW networks was explained by the catalytic effect of Cr2O3 and the extension of the electron depletion layer via the formation of pn junctions.

Introduction	Abstract: Innovative approaches to managing wild fish stocks have been introduced in recent years, most notably by New Zealand and Australia, where Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) are now being used as instruments of commercial fishery regulation. An ITQ is a legally defensible right to catch, land, and market a quantity of fish over a certain period of time, held by an individual or a firm, and tradable in asset markets in the usual way. Taken together, these characteristics qualify an ITQ as a private property right, an instrument for extending the institution of property from land to the sea.	Philip A.

Chia Seeds and the Columbus Concept	Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major problem worldwide, and is the most common cause of death in the Western world. Diets high in total fat, saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids and having high ω-6:ω-3 fatty acid ratios have been directly linked to risk of suffering coronary heart disease (CHD). Chia (Salvia hispanica L) is the highest known plant source of ω-3 fatty acids, and also is a good source of fiber and protein. Its natural antioxidants keep it stable, even when ground, so it can be stored for extended periods of time without degradation taking place. Chia has been fed to chickens and other animals, and has significantly improved the lipidic profile of the products produced as well as the serum of rats, with no evidence of a decrease in product quality or animal health. This is unlike flaxseed and fish oil/meal which have been shown to give off flavors (fishy flavor) to eggs, and in the case of flaxseed, reduced egg production. Adding chia to bread and other bakery products could provide consumers with an easily obtainable, low cost food that would significantly increase their ω-3 intake without having to change their normal diet, or be faced with an allergic reaction which can occur when eating fish. As chia becomes more of a mainstream source of ω-3 fatty acids its price will decrease, and if added to bakery products, it would provide a large percentage of the world’s population with a low cost source of ω-3 fatty acids.

Potential sources of 2-aminoacetophenone to confound the Pseudomonas aeruginosa breath test, including analysis of a food challenge study	2-Aminoacetophenone can be detected in the breath of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized cystic fibrosis patients; however, low levels were also detected in a small proportion of healthy subjects. It was hypothesized that food, beverages, cosmetics or medications could be a source of contamination of 2-aminoacetophenone in breath. To determine the potential confounding of these products on 2-aminoacetophenone breath analysis, screening for this volatile was performed in the laboratory by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a food challenge study carried out. 2-Aminoacetophenone was detected in four of the 78 samples tested in vitro: corn chips and canned tuna (high pmol mol1) and egg white and one of the three beers (low pmol mol1). No 2-aminoacetophenone was detected in the CF medication or cosmetics tested. Twenty-eight out of 30 environmental air samples were negative for 2-aminoacetophenone (below 50 pmol mol1). A challenge study with ten healthy subjects was performed to determine if 2-aminoacetophenone from corn chips was detectable on the breath after consumption. Analysis of mixed breath samples reported that the levels of 2-aminoacetophenone were immediately elevated after corn chip consumption, but after 2 h the level of 2-aminoacetophenone had reduced back to the baseline for each subject.

Fish Reproductive Pheromones	Abstract: Chemical communication in fish is known or suspected to be involved in a wide range of functions including general social attraction, species and individual recognition, parent-young interactions, alarm or fright reactions, migration, and a variety of reproductive responses including stimulation of spawning readiness, sexual attraction, and elicitation of courtship behavior (Colombo et al., 1982; Liley, 1982; Liley and Stacey, 1983). We will deal exclusively with reproductive aspects of chemical communication in fish (i.e. chemical communication between individuals which directly alters reproductive development or the likelihood of sexual behavior) and will not be concerned with non-reproductive social interactions. Emphasis will be placed on developments which have occurred since the publication of earlier reviews, with particular attention being given to the possible chemical nature of fish reproductive pheromones, the information which these chemical signals might transmit, and the mode of action by which they are thought to induce the observed reproductive responses. As little is known of many of these aspects of chemical communication in fish, it is hoped that the present article will serve as a focus and stimulus for further research in this area.	N. E.

Numerical analysis of a unique mode of locomotion: vertical climbing by Pacific lamprey	Pacific lampreys are capable of climbing vertical wetted surfaces through a two-phase (bending and stretching) locomotion mode using the oral disc for adherence. We investigate the physical mechanism and performance of this process by using a continuous beam model. Two mechanisms, one akin to the jumping process and the other related to the fast stretching of the body, have been identified. This locomotion mode may inspire biomimetic designs of anguilliform swimming devices capable of overcoming steep obstacles. By using a genetic algorithm simulation we identify the combination of kinematic parameters corresponding to optimal efficiency (defined as the gravitational potential energy gained in each climbing step divided by the energy spent to activate the motion). These parameters are similar to laboratory observations of lamprey motion, suggesting that this type of locomotion has been optimized for maximum efficiency through evolution.

Modelling Groundfish Supply: A Linear Programming Approach with Application to Newfoundland	Abstract: Most of the work on modelling supply of fishery products makes extensive use of econometric techniques. This approach requires time series data that have been generated under conditions of relative stability of non-economic factors. For many fisheries, this condition is not met. Following extended fisheries jurisdiction, for example, new fisheries have emerged and others have been substantially reduced; some have disappeared. In this paper, a linear programming method is introduced to simulate supply of groundfish products in the context of a global groundfish model. A pilot system was developed and run with data from and application to Newfoundland.	Ingolfur Arnarson, Richard S. Johnston	Econometric Modelling of the World Trade in Groundfish	1991	1	1
Fisheries Acoustics: Assessment of Fish Stocks and Observation of Fish Behaviour	Abstract: There is still an upward trend in the global yield from fisheries and most of the 139 coastal states in the world need to know what fisheries resources are available to them, although not all have declared Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ’s). These 200-mile zones offer an excellent chance to control exploitation and to manage natural resources but there are difficulties in understanding the fluctuations of fish populations and in forecasting their abundance.

A great variety of effects is listed, together with their significance for the scatterers themselves and for the resulting sonar limitations.	D. E.

Fish	Abstract: Most fish are caught from the wild in nets or with lines of baited hooks. Some die before being hauled from the water, some suffer physical damage, and all, farmed or wild, are inevitably stressed before death. These, and other differences due to biological condition, structure, composition and post-mortem change, present fish processors and distributors with a raw material very different from other food materials used in modern processing industries.

Kinematic Modeling and Dynamic Analysis of the Long-Based Undulation Fin of Gymnarchus Niloticus	Abstract: Within median and/or paired fin (MPF) propulsion, many fish routinely use the long-based undulatory fins as the sole means of locomotion. In this paper, the long-based undulatory fin of an Amiiform fish“G. niloticus”was investigated. We brought forward a simplified physical model and a kinematic model to simulate the undulations of the long-based dorsal fin. Further, the equilibrium equations of the undulatory fin were obtained by applying the membrane theory of thin shells in which the geometrical non-linearity of the structure is taken into account. Last, we apply the derived kinematic model and equilibrium equations of the undulatory fin to analyze the thrust and propulsive efficiency varying with the aspect ratio of the fin and the maximum swing amplitude.

Effects of Transmitted Light and Bubbles in Open-Channel Flows on Fish Behaviors	Abstract: Fish sometimes enters into an intake gate of dams. Some techniques with electricity, transmitted light and air bubbles have been developed to avoid fish from the intake gate. However, a lot of fisheries co-operative associations pointed out that most of such techniques have no effect. In this study, the color types of transmitted light are changed at both sides of a rectangular water tank and swimming area of Zacco platypus are observed. Further, the air bubbles are injected from the channel bottom and trajectories of fish are observed.

A Case Study on a Project by a Fisheries Cooperative	Abstract: Fishery is not so big an industry among today’s modern industries. But in many small communities, like local towns and villages in Japan, it is still a key industry for developing those areas. This report introduces a typical project which has brought a certain development to a community by efforts of a fisheries cooperative, based on fishery, through integrated measures combining fishery and resort. The project suggests many things about the way of development in local areas, especially in coastal places where fishery is a major industry. In the near future of Japan, fisheries cooperatves’ should play more important roles for developing local areas because coordinate activity connecting fishery with other industries will become very common in local areas.

A Behavior Based Control and Learning Approach to Real Robots	Abstract: Programming a real robot to do a given task in unstructured dynamic environments is very challenge. Incomplete information, large learning space, and uncertainty are major obstacles for control in real robots. When programming a real robot in unstructured dynamic environments, it is impossible to predict all the potential situation robots may encounter and specify all robot behaviors optimally in advance. Robots have to learn from, and adapt to their operating environment. In this chapter, we propose to use fuzzy logic to design robot behaviors and use a Markov decision process to model the coordination mechanism in the control and learning of real autonomous robotic systems. Based on the model, a Q-learning approach can be used to learn the behavior coordination. Two real robot applications are implemented by using such an approach, one is a Sony quadruped robot for soccer playing and another is a robotic fish for entertainment. Real robot testing results are provided to verify the proposed approach.	Dongbing Gu, Jindong Liu, Huosheng Hu	Design and Control of Intelligent Robotic Systems	2009	1	1

Multi-View Acoustic Sizing and Classification of Individual Fish	Abstract: Estimating biophysical parameters of fish populations in situ such as size, orientation, shape, and taxa is a fundamental goal in oceanography. Towards this end, acoustics is a natural choice due to its rapid, non-invasive capabilities. Here, multi-view methods are explored for classification, size and orientation estimation, and 2D image reconstruction for individual fish. Size- and shape-based classification using multi-view data is shown to be accurate (~10% error) using kernel methods and discriminant analysis. For species-based classification in the absence of significant differences in size or shape, multi-view methods offer significant (~40%) reduction in error, but absolute error rates remain high (~20%) due to the lack of discriminant information in acoustic scatter. Length and orientation estimation are investigated using a parameter-based approach with a simple ellipsoidal scattering model. Good accuracy is obtained when the views span the full 360°. When the span is limited to less than 60°, incorporating a prior constraint on possible body shapes can lead to reduced uncertainty in the estimated parameters. Finally, using views that span the full 360°, sparse Bayesian learning coupled with a conventional Radon transform yields accurate two-dimensional, projected images of the fish.	P. L. D.
